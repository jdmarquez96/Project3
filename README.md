# Project3

To execute the code, just run the file through the command line i.e 
python3 Project3.py

If wanting to change the code, open the code up with any code editor.
You will see a couple of variables: m0, s0, Nmeas, Nexp, detector.
Change the variables to whatever you desire. Keep in mind that
scipy.optimze.curve_fit in the program needs the guess to be 
somewhat close to the values in m0 and s0. If the guess is far out,
the code could fail.
